# üì® **Inbie**  
### Your inbox, ready before you wake.

This is my latest productivity hack:  
An **RAG-powered AI email assistant** named **Inby** that sorts, labels, and drafts replies automatically, so you wake up to a fully organized inbox ‚Äî complete with smart drafts and templates ready to go.

## ‚öôÔ∏èWhat Inby Does

- Sorts and **categorizes your emails** by what needs a reply and what doesn't
- **Drafts personalized responses** using your tone and preferences
- Fully customizable with **user-specific rules and filters**
- Periodically updates and **saves all drafts locally** using **Turso + Drizzle**
- Uses **tRPC** and **Hono** for API routing
- Integrates **OpenAI + Claude** models with the **Gmail API** via **Google OAuth**
- Runs on the **mastra_ai TypeScript framework** for building RAG agents
