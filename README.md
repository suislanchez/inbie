Your inbox, ready before you wake.

This is my latest productivity hack:
an RAG AI Agent email assistant that sorts, labels, and drafts replies automatically, so you wake up to a fully organized inbox with drafts and tempalates ready to go. 
	•	Built with a custom RAG AI agent using mastra_ai Typescript framework
	•	Labels what needs replying, drafts smart responses, and lets you approve or ignore
	•	Fully customizable rules per user
	•	Periodically updates and saves everything locally using Turso + Drizzle
 	•	API routing with tRPC and Hono servers
  •	OpenAI and Claude models, Gmail API + Google OAuth

Full Stack: 
React + TanStack Router + tRPC + Hono + Bun + SQLite + NativeWind + Expo


I’m testing out ideas and directions.
Would you use something like this to clean your inbox for you?
Let me know how you’d improve it or what features you’d want next.

to test it out:

run bun dev in root, and setup google oauth permissions and env variables for GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID AND GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET. VITE_URL and tRPC -> Hono servers setup automatically.
